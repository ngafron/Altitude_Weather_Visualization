Web Design Challenge - Altitude and Weather Visualization

Description:
For this project, I learned how to utilize HTML5 and CSS for a front-end development. The requirements for this project were to have...
1. A landing page containing:
  - An explanation of the project.
  - Links to each visualizations page.


2. Four visualization pages, each with:
  - A descriptive title and heading tag.
  - The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  - A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.


3. A "Comparisons" page that:
  - Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
  - Uses a bootstrap grid for the visualizations.


4. A "Data" page that:
  - Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
  - The table must be a bootstrap table component.
  - The data must come from exporting the .csv file as HTML, or converting it to HTML utilizing Pandas.
  
The website also needed to be responsive and utilize other bootstrap objects. All of the data visualization and analysis was utilized from a previous project (https://github.com/ngafron/API-Challenge)
